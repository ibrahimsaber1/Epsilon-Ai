## <p style="color:orange;">Q.03 Write a Python program to print yesterday, today, tomorrow.</p>
# Answer here 
import datetime

today_date = datetime.date.today()

one_day_after = datetime.timedelta(days= 1)

one_day_before = datetime.timedelta(days=-1)

print(f"""Today Date = {today_date}\nYesterday Date = {today_date + one_day_before}
Tomorrow Date = {today_date + one_day_after}""")
# today_date = datetime.date.today()

# today_year = today_date.year
# today_month = today_date.month
# today_day = today_date.day

# print(f'{today_year} / {today_month} / {today_day}')
