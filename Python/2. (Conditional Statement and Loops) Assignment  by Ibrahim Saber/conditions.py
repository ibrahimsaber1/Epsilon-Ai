# Answer here 

st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'

my_st = st.split()

for word in my_st:
    if word.startswith("s"):
        print(word)

# Here I wanted to print the words on the same line just to use join :)..

st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'
my_st = st.split()

my_st1 = []
for word in my_st:
    if word.startswith("s"):
        my_st1.append(word)

final_st = ' '.join(my_st1)

print(final_st)

# Answer here 

st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'

st1 = [word for word in st.split() if word.startswith('s')]

print(st1)

## <p style="color:green;">Q.8 Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.</p>
# >[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
# Answer here : 
# 1. from celsius to fahrenheit...
c = float(input('pleas enter the degree in Celsius ')) 

f = c * (9/5)+32

print(f"{c} Celsius is equal to {f} Fahrenheit")

# 2. from fahrenheit to celsius...
f = float(input('pleas enter the degree in fahrenheit ')) 

c = (f - 32)*(5/9)

print(f"{f} Fahrenheit is equal to {c} Celsius")
